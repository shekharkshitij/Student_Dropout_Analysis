# Student_Dropout_Analysis
This project merges student dropout analysis with a Tkinter-based prediction app. Users input academic, attendance,
previous performance, and socio-economic data, and predictive modeling forecasts dropout likelihood. The intuitive
interface aids institutions in identifying at-risk students and implementing targeted interventions.
